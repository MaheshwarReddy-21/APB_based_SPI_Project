# APB_based_SPI_Project
This project implements SPI Controller integrated with an AMBA APB slave interface. It enables a processor or host to communicate with SPI-based peripherals.  Designed using Verilog RTL, verified through simulation, and validated using linting and synthesis flows, this project demonstrates end-to-end digital IP development.
